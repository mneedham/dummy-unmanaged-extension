= An example of a Neo4j unmanaged extension

This project is intended as a simple template for creating a Neo4j unmanaged extension.

I downloaded Neo4j to this directory so the following instructions make that assumption about its location.
If you've got Neo4j running elsewhere then change the instructions appropriately.

First let's package the unmanaged extension:

```
mvn package
```

Now let's copy it into the Neo4j plugins folder:

```
cp target/dummy-unmanaged-extension-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar neo4j-community-2.2.3/plugins/
```

Next we add the following line to conf/neo4j-server.properties

```
org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes=org.neo4j.unmanaged=/unmanaged
```



```
$ curl -H "Accept-Encoding:gzip,deflate" http://localhost:7474/unmanaged/dummy/all-nodes
�V���K�MU��V�M,�V�Q��L��IU����-�
```

If we want to see that in clear text we can pipe the output through gunzip:

```
$ curl -H "Accept-Encoding:gzip,deflate" http://localhost:7474/unmanaged/dummy/all-nodes | gunzip
{"n.name":["Mark","Nicole"]}
```

Much better.
