= An example of a Neo4j unmanaged extension

This project is intended as a simple template for creating a Neo4j unmanaged extension.
The unmanaged extension returns an array containing the `name` property of all nodes in the database.

I downloaded Neo4j to this directory so the following instructions make that assumption about its location.
If you've got Neo4j running elsewhere then change the instructions appropriately.

First let's build a JAR containing our unmanaged extension:

```
mvn assembly:single
```

Now let's copy it into the Neo4j plugins folder:

```
cp target/dummy-unmanaged-extension-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar neo4j-community-2.2.3/plugins/
```

Next we add the following line to conf/neo4j-server.properties

```
org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes=org.neo4j.unmanaged=/unmanaged
```

Now let's go to the Neo4j browser at http://localhost:7474 and put some data in:

```
create (p:Person {name: "Nicole"})
```

```
create (p:Person {name: "Mark"})
```

Now we can make some calls to our unmanaged extension:

```
$ curl http://localhost:7474/unmanaged/dummy/all-nodes
{"people":[{"name":"Mark"},{"name":"Nicole"}]}
```

The extension can also return us a gzipped response if we ask for it:

```
$ curl -H "Accept-Encoding:gzip,deflate" http://localhost:7474/unmanaged/dummy/all-nodes
�V*H�/�IU���V�K�2�|���ju�|���|����Zw �Z.
```

I'm not so good at reading gzipped but if we want to see that in clear text we can pipe the output through gunzip:

```
$ curl -H "Accept-Encoding:gzip,deflate" http://localhost:7474/unmanaged/dummy/all-nodes | gunzip
{"people":[{"name":"Mark"},{"name":"Nicole"}]}
```

Much better.
